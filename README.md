# TimelessPvP-V5

TimelessPvP-V5 is an arena kit pvp plugin with configurable spawn and lobby points. It was made primarily for use on a personal server with me and my friends. If you want to use it go ahead. I would love it if anyone found enjoyment from the project. More kits will be added in the future. Later down the line I may add some alternate gamemodes, like TDM or CTF, will be added if I have the time and desire to do so.

## History
TimelessPvP-V5 is a continuation of the TimlessPvP series of minecraft minigames stemming from the DiamondFire server.
